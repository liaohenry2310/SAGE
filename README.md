My student assembled game engine, developed in my time at LaSalle College Vancouver. 

## Current Features:
- Directx11 3D rendering
- Multi-pass rendering
- Post-processing
- Dynamic lighting
- Dynamic shadows
- 3D asset importing via the Open Asset Import library.
- Skeletal animtaions with GPU skinning
- Particle-based physics system
- Entity-component based gameplay systems

Big thanks to my intructor, Peter Chan, who taught and helped me through the entire development and design process.
